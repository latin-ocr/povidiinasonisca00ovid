ἶ 60. custodia: for custos, the abstract being put sor the con·
ete. Among the Romans the goose was reckoned watchful
night3 so in the story of the saving of the Capitol by
anlius on the warning os sacred geese, when Rome was bc-
eged by the Gauls‚ 390 Β. C. As Spenser pithily states the
se (“Visions of the World’s Vanitie '’):

“ So, when all shrouded were in silent night,

The Galles were, by corrupting of a mayde,

Possest nigh of the capitol through flight,

Had not a Goose the treachery bewrayde.

If then a Goose great Rome from ruin stayde,

And Jove himselfe, the patron of the place,

Preserved from being to his foes betrayde‚

Why do vaine men mean things so much deface,
And in their might repose their most assurance‚
Sith nought on earth can chalenge long endurance?''
