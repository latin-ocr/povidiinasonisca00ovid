6. positis: in the sense of depositis. alis: his winged
andals. It is an interesting coincidence that not {ar froin the
egion where our poet places the scene of this myth, Barnabas
nd Paul were taken for Jupiter and Mercury (Zeus and Her-
es) in human form3 Paul for Mercury “because he was the
hies speaker.'' See Acts xiv. 8-13.

8. Mille domos: the repetition emphasizes the inhospitality

f the region. una: ulca domus. 11. Ι11Ξιε in illd cassi.
2. fatendo: by not striving to conceal their poverty. 13. le-
em: i. e. easy to endure. nec iniqua mente: et non
iniquit· mente, ‘and with no discontented spirit.’ 15: duo:
.‘they two.’ Cf. p. 92, l. 191.

vertice: the door was so low that the gods had to stoop in

(sedile).

‘takes down.' The gods are to have a dish of bacon boiled
1with vegetables. 27. Sordida: from the smoke. Cottages of

{tignoz a rafter.

ἶ 30. medias fallunt horas: ‘they while away the intervening
=time,’ while the dinner is being prepared. 31. concutiunt
torum: ‘they shake up the cushion‚’ for the guests to recline
on at dinner. Ovid projects back on the Heroic Age, when
men are represented as having sat at table, the practice of his
rown time, when it was the custom to recline at meals.
132. sponda (saligna) pedibusque salignis: abl. of character-
²istic, describing the couch (lecto). All this suggests a striking
y *contrast to the couches of bronze or even richer material, and
Ι the cushions of down or of wool, with their bright-colored,
. 'often richly embroidered coverings‚ found in the houses of the
