“Orpheus with his lute made trees,
And the mountain tops, that freeze,
Bow themselves, when he did sing:
To his music, plants and fiowers
Ever sprung, as sun and showers
There had made 3 lasting spring.

“Every thing that heard him play,
Even the billows of the sea,
Hung their heads, and then lay by.
In sweet music is such art:
Killing care and grief of beart,
Fall asleep, or, hearing, die.''
