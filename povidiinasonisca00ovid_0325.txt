bought to be inspired; see p. 62, Selection 14, and N. This
ribute ‘cov the immortality of verse finds an interesting parallel
n Spenser’s “Ruins of Time’ :

“For deeds doe die, however noblie donne,
And thoughts of men do as themselves decay3
But wise words, taught in numbers for to mnne,
Recorded by the Muses, live for ay;
Ne may with storming showers be washt away,
Ne bitter breathing windes with harmful blast,
'Nor age, nor envie‚ shall them ever wast.'’

·'‘ But Fame, with golden wings‚ aloft doth flie,
Above the reach of ruinous decay,
And with brave plumes doth beate the azure skie,
Admir’d of base-borne men from farre away:
Then, who so will with vertuous deeds assay
To mount to heaven on Pegasus must ride,
And with sweete Poets verse be glorifide.'’
