28 INTRODUCTION

earth. They lived long, in blessedness like that of the
gods, who often carne to earth and associated with them.
After death they became beneficent spirits, dwelling unseen
among men.

After the overthrow of Kronos carne the Silver Age,
inferior to the Golden. Men were now slower in physi-
cal development, yet of larger and finer form than we.
Becoming haughty and sels-willed‚ they even refused to
give due honor to the gods, who more and more with-
drew from relations with them. Zeus took them from the
earth and made them ghosts of the Underworld.

Then followed the Brome Age, full of strife and violence.
Men fell at one another's hands, or wore themselves³
out in constant warfare‚ and perished soul and body.

Last came the Imm Age. Enfeebled man must now·
earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. While men were
struggling in this hard condition, Prolelzeus, Forethought,
son of the Titan sapam, brought them fire from heaven
and taught them its uses, thus leading them to a knowl-
edge of the arts. For this Zeus condemned him to
unending torture. He was chained upon a bleak cliff.
Here an eagle each day ate out his liver, which grew
again at night.

But men were not content with honest toil, and tried
in every way, to get the advantage of one another. They
became so desperately wicked that Zeus sent a great
flood upon the earth. All perished save two, Deucali5n
and Iffrrrlca. These, directed by the gods, cast stones be-
hind them, which became men and women, progenitors of
the present race. But wickedness still remains. The gods
have long since ceased to visit the earth as they did of old,
and are often obliged to send punishment for sin.
