THE GREEK ANI) THE ROMAN MY'I'HOLOGY 23

myths of the one ascribed to the other. As educated Romans
became saturated with the Greek culture, the Greek myths
came to be as familiar to them as their own, and consequently
occupy as prominent a place in the Roman literature as in
the Greek.

The old gods remained too firmly entrenched in the affec-
tions of the common folk to be replaced by foreign deities 5
but only occasionally did Roman authors attempt to treat
the native myths‚ as Varro did in prose, and Ovid in his
‘Calendan’ to some extent also in the last two books of
the Metamorphoses, In later times, especially after the
commencement of the Christian era, the Romans turned to
the worship of Egyptian and other strange divinities.

The early Roman no doubt believed devoutly in his gods
and what was said of them. But with the Greek mythol-
ogy came also the seeds of unbelief. The forms of the
state religion at Rome were kept up, as a matter of policy,
for several centuries after the majority of those belonging
to the higher classes of society had ceased to believe in
their efficacy. The Roman writers, like those of the later
Greek literature, found their chief interest in the myths as
material for poetic treatment.
