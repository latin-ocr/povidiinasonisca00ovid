gardens and flowers, the bestower of female beauty and
grace, the guardian of marriage and family life.

conductor of souls in the Underworld. On earth he was
considered as the guardian of roads and guide of travel-
lers, the protector of herds, and patron-deity of thieves.

Hestia, daughter of Kronos and Rhea, goddess of the hearth.
As the hearth-fire was intimately connected with the
interests of the family, she was looked to as the dis-
penser of domestic blessings. She was also worshipped
at the public hearths as guardian of cities.

H Elios, god of the sun, father of Phaethon.
