50. Illic . . . Ammon: Ammon iniustus (trans. as avaffl
iusserat immeritam Andromedan illic (in Aethiopia) penderat
poenas maternae linguae. Cepheus, king of Aethiopia, ani
his fair queen Cassiope, had a daughter, Andromeda, of rare·
beauty. Once Cassiope rashly boasted either that she her*
self or that her daughter (some say one, some the other) was..
more beautiful than the Nereids. The slighted goddesses api- ξ
pealed to Poseidon (Neptune) for vengeance. He listened to=
their petition and sent a devastating fiood over Aethiopia, and-c
caused a terrible sea-monster, following in the wake of the&
flood, to prey upon the land, devouring every living thing that ,Γ
it could reach. Cepheus sent to consult the oracle of Jupiter
Ammon in the African desert, inquiring what could be done to ³
appease the wrath of the divinities. Word came back that the J‘j
plague of the land would cease only if Andromeda were given
up to the sea-monster. Forced by the clamors of the people, =
the sad parents carried out the condition named by the oracle, ’
and chained the girl to a cliff overhanging the sea, where the .
monster might find her. Just as he was approaching to claim ξ
his prey, Perseus appeared and slew him with the unerring 3¹
blade of Hermes. The hero gave the maid back to her parents, ..s
only to receive her himself in marriage and carry her away to f
Greece to be his queen. Immense bones of a skeleton forty ‘j
feet in length, supposed to be those of the sea-monster slain by ¹
Perseus, were (lug up near Joppa in Judaea (where the scene ᾗ
of the rescue, in one form of the myth, is laid), and carried
to Rome in the first century B. C., where they were-shown as a -
wonder by M. Scaurus (Pliny, Naturalis Historia, IX. V. 11). f³
The sacrifice and rescue of Andromeda form the theme of ἶ
Kingsley's poem, “Andromeda'' ξ,
