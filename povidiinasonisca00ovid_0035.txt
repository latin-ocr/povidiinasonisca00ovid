ovib AND His wokks 11

ings read very much like a modern novel. Ovid was a
romancer as well as poet.

This nonchalant presentation of the characters and myths
of the old religion could hardly fail to please the poet's free—
thinking contemporaries, and was one of the principal reasons
why his works immediately became popular. He had
touched a responsive chord. The light handling of mytho-

by the standards of the times, full of originality. Like all
Roman writers, he drew both his inspiration and his ideas
largely from the Greek literature. He also borrowed freely
