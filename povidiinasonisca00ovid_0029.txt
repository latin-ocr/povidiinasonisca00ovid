ovio AND His worms 5

often been condemned as unmanly. He was certainly not of
heroic mould. 1f he had been, his poetry would have lacked
that ease and grace which distinguish him above every other
Roman poet. We should remember, too, that the Poenis of
Exile were written at intervals, during a period of eight or
nine years, and hence, being received at Rome at different
times, must have produced a far disserent impression from that
left upon us, who have them all together and may read the
whole collection at a sitting. They were composed also fully

as much to relieve the poet's own feelings as to move his
friends. In laudation of Augustus, he simply conformed to the

fashion of the time. lf Vergil and Horace could sing of the
Emperor as a god upon earth, Ovid certainly should not be

brought to task for fulsome praise at a time when his very
life hung trembling in the Emperor’s power. Though we may
not admire Ovid in exile, we can well understand how, torn
from his horne, his wife, and all earth held dear, condemned
to languish in an inhospitable clime without a single congenial
companion‚ he pined away, and finally died broken-hearted.
