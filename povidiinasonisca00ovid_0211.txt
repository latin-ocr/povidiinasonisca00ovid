CHAUCER ε Prologue to The Legende of Goode XVomen.

1. Chloris: = Χλωρὶς, the Greek goddess of flowers, repre-
ented as wife of Zephyrus the West XVincL no doubt because the
blowing of the west wind accompanied the opening of spring3
fdentified by the Romans with Flora, to whom the myth of
Chloris as related here was transferred.

2. Nostri: =mez'. Cf. B. 242, 33 A. 98, 1, ὧς H. 446, N.
2. The meaning is, that the name Flora was derived from
Χλωρίς, with only the irregular change of X to F, and of course
the ending. The poet's derivation is fanciful, for Flora comes
¹from the stem flor· in flos‚florz's‚ ‘flower' (root FLA‚ ΡΜ), found
also in Greek φύλλον, (ιθ3ἱ3 and English blow, bloom), while Χλω-
ρίς is connected with χλωρός,ι green, ’and χλόη, green shoot.’

3. semper: because Spring was unending in the Happy Isles
in the far, far west, where Flora was supposed to dwell.
