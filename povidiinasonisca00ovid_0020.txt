iv PREFACE

to the religion, life, literature, and art of the ancientS.
For further reading, a list of books treating of the
classical mythology is given on page 297.

The Notes are elementary; at the same time, they
aim to suggest a poetic interpretation of our author.
There is no reason why verse so simple and flowing as
that of Ovid may not bc read and appreciated as poetry
from tlie beginning. 'she illustrations are intended to
be lielpful in the elucidation of both text and intro.-
duction.

ln the preparation of the Outline of Mythology the
editor was most indebted to Preller's “Griechische
Mythologic and ¹⁶ Romische Mythologie‚'’ and Lang's
‘⁶ Myth, Ritual, and Religion.'' In writing the NoteS,
the editions of the Fasti by Hallam and Paley, of the
Tristia by Owen, of the Ibis by Robinson Ellis, and of
the Metamorphoses by Haupt and Siebelis, were per-
haps oftenest consulted. Thanks are due to Assistant
Professor J. C. Rolfe and Mr. W. K. Clement, of the
University of Michigan, for valuable assistance in re-

vising the proofs of the Notes and Vocabulary.
