6 INTRODUCTMHQ

ii. THE WORKs OF Ovn).

Tm: works of Ovid now extant may best be considered in
three groups, — Love-poemS‚ Mythological poems, and Poems
of Exile. The love-poems were written in the earlier period of

his life, the mythological poems in middle life, the poems of
exile when the poet was languishing at Tomi.

1. Lovss—POEMS.

Amores, ‘Loves.' In three books, containing in all¹ sorty-
nine miscellaneous short poenis, chiefly of an amatory char-
aeter.

lz'pz'stulae, or Heroides, ‘ Epistles.’ A collection of fictitious
love-letters in elegiae verse, supposed to have been written
by personages of the heroic age to their absent lovers.
'l‘wenty-one of these epistles are extant, of which certainly
one, and perhaps six, were composed not by Ovid himself,
but by some imitator. Among the best-known epistles are
those of Penelope to Ulysses‚ Dido to Aeneas, Ariadne to
Theseus, and Medea to Iason.

De slscdt'camine Facies, ‘On F ace-cosmetics.’ A frag-
mentary poem of a hundred lines, addressed to the ladies
aml rc‹·.om1nen‹ling certain preparations for beautifying the
complexion.

Ars Amatoria, ‘Art of Love.' In three books, discussing
ways of winning and retaining the affections.

Remedia Amoris, ‘Iove-cures) A treatise on the best
means of conquering an unreciprocated affection. This poem

and the preceding reflect the luxury and vice οξ the time, and
are ill—suited to modern taste.
