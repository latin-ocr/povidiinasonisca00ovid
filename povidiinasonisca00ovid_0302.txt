147. In patriam: to Lydia (see N. tol. 1). On the
northern side of Mt. Sipylus in Lydia, not far from Mag}
nesia, the rude form of a woman may be seen in the lime}
stone rock, about half way up a steep cliff. The figure is in'
sitting posture, about three times the natural size. Thoug-
it was originally perhaps a freak of nature, some traces ol
carving are still visible on close examination. The dripping
of water down the cliff over the face gives even now the
appearance of weeping. This figure has been called Niobe*
it seems to be a prehistoric image of Cybele. Ἴ

The story of Niobe belongs to a very large class of myth33
common in other mythologies as well as the Greek, which
relate as their outcome a transformation into stone. (Com
pare, for example, the story of Battus, p. 1063 of Atlas*
p. 1223 for others briefiy mentioned see Lang, “Myth, Κίωεύ,
and Religion‚” Vol. Ι. p. 150 et seq.) What their origin is
it is not possible to determine with certainty3 but some wer·-v
probably suggested at the beginning by natural appearances
bearing a real or fancied resemblance to the human face on,
figure, such as “the Old Man of the Mountain‚'’ near the
Profile House, New Hampshire. ²
