d. Divinities of the Underworld and Death.

The early Roman notions about the Underworld, so far as
they went, were similar to those of the Greeks. But they were
not carried out so far in detail as the Greek, and were influ-
enced in their development by the Roman ancestor-worship.

The principal divinities of the underworld were :

Orcus, lord of the Underworld, who like a harvester gath-
ers the souls of the dead into his tretisure-house. In
later times Orcus was often identified with the Greek
Plzvtbn.
