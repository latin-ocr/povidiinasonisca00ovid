Pisaeae Arethusae: Arethusa was called ‘of Pisa‚’ 1Pisaean‚3 ξ’
from the town Pisa, in Elis. In this region, according to Ovidt
the fair nymph Arethusa dwelt. The god of the river Alpheus ζ
fell violently in love with her. She tried to resist his advances,
but the god pursued her, and as she felt her own strength 2
failing she prayed to Diana (Artemis) for help. The goddess ¹
changed her into a spring, and made a way for her waters to ¹
flow under the earth from Elis to Ortygia, where they came .
again to the surface. The waters of the Alpheus, mingling, .
fiowed with them, and it was a current belief in antiquity that
a cup or other object thrown into the Alpheus in Elis would *

come up in the spring Arethusa. In the graceful lines of
Shelley (“ Arethusa ⁷³) t

‘⁶ Down one vale where the morning basks,
Like friends once parted
Grown single-hearted,

They ply their watery tasks.
At sunrise they leap
From their cradles steep
In the cave of the shelving hill;
At noontide they flow
Through the woods below
And the meadows of Asphodel3
And at night they sleep
In the rocking deep
Beneath the Ortygiam shore3—
Like spirits that lie
In the azure sky
&Vhen they love but live no more.’'

Arethusa was sometimes addressed and spoken of as a muse
of pastoral poetry'. So in Milton's ‘⁶ Lycidas ” and Horace
Smith's “Sicilian Arethusa.”

the maid from Henna as far as the pool Cyane.
