13 INTRODUCTION

modern times, especially since the sixteenth century, the view ’
has had wide prevalence that certain myths resembling the
ssiblieal narratives reflect‚ in a fragmentary and corrupt form,
a primitive <livine revelation, which in its purity is preserved
in the Book os Genesis.

Recent investigators in Comparative Mythology agree in
attributing the origin of mytlis to purely natural causes. In
the explanations offered, however, there is considerable di-

principally upon an exhaustive analysis of the names of the
divinities in the Indo-European languages, reduce all myths
to a primitive personification of the* sky, earth, and heavenly
bodies, and the natural phenomena connected with these,
emphasizmg particularly the sun, clouds, and dawn. The

Helen being “ simply the radiant light, whether of the morning
or of the evening.’' (Cox, ‘Mythology of the Aryan Nations,’
p. 389.) With this view Herbert Spencer agrees in many
pointS, offering, however, his own explanation of the way that
the powers of nature came to be looked upon as animate, and
involved in human relations.

But of recent theories perhaps that of which Andrew Lang
is a prominent advocate will be found as reasonable as any.
This view does· not find the origin of myths in the personifi-

about him. In ‘the early days of the race men appear to
have thought of themselves as intimately related with all
animal life3 hence they considered changes of form of all
