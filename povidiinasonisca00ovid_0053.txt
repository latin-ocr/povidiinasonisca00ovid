THE GREEK MYTHorocY 29

3. MYTHs OF DEITIES.

The divinities of the Greeks were so numerous, and the
myths connected with them were so many and of so great
variety, that only brief mention of them separately can here
be made. They may be considered in four groups: divinities
of Heaven, divinities of the Sea and Waters, divinities of the
Earth, and divinities of the Underworld. The divinities of
Heaven were thought to have much to do also with the earth
and the life of men. Several of the divinities of the earth
were intimately connected with those of the Underworld.

a. Divinities ot* Heaven.

The divinities of Heaven were divided into two classes:
s, the Great Gods, and the Lesser Gods. They dwelt above Mt.
( Olympus, whence they came to earth whenever invoked‚ being

ι ubiquitous rather than omnipresent.

The Great Gods were ten in number : ¹
Zeus, greatest of gods, often called father of gods and men.
He was regarded as gatherer of clouds and sender of
rain, the. bestower of physical prowess and valor, the
protector of the relations based on kinship, friendship,
or treaties. He was the hurler of the thunderbolt against
the guilty, the refuge also of the penitent. He was re-
presented as often visiting the earth in various disguises,
and especially susceptible to the charms of beautiful
women. Hence arose a great number of myths. As
the Greeks were monogamists, the loves of Zeus are
difficult to account for unless they are interpreted as
different personifications of the same natural phenom-

1 With these sometimes Poseidon (see p. 33) and Demeter (see p. 34)
are reckoned, making twelve “Great Gods’' in all.
