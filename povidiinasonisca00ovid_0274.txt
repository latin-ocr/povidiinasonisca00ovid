and were changed into dolpliins, he alone being safe3 and lm
he resolved ever after to devote himself to the service of tl
god. This tale of the might of Bacchus did not move tl
king, who bade his attendants to slay Acoetes with the mot
cruel tortureS. But as these were preparing, the prison doo·
flew open, the manacles of their own accord dropped fr·
Acoetes⁷s hands, and he went forth free to join his band. So«
after this, Pentheus concealed himself on Mt. Cithaeron in o ι’
to witness the sacred rites, and was espied by a band of w
men frenzied with the Bacchic worship. Thinking him a w'
beast, they attacked him, his own mother leading them οι
and tore him limb from limb. The story of Bacchus and t*
mariners forms the theme of one of the finest of the Home!
hymns. It is also illustrated on a curious ancient vase l
Berlin, and in the frieze of the celebrated choregic monumo
of Lysicrates, at Athens. (A reproduction of the vase· paintin

Lang, may be found in the “Magazine of Art’' for Au „
