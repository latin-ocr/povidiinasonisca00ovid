Capital. He sought especially the acquaintance of pocts.
Supported by his patrimony and thus relieved from the nc-
cessity of labor, whenever the impulse moved him he wrote.
His poe-tic powers at first, not unnaturally‚ expended them-
selves on subjects congenial to the society in which he moved.
He published a group of productioris the central thought of
which was love,—not love as revealed in home-life, but judged
according to the low standard of the age. Later, encouraged
by the success of these earlier efforts, 116 freed himself some-
what from the associations of former years, and attempted
more serious themes. Ovid was twice married, twice speed-
ily divorced. His third marriage was more happy, and re-
mained unbroken till death.

To the pleasure-loving poet, years had passed quickly and
merrily by. But in a moment all was changed. Without a
word of warning, in the year 8 Α. D. an order came from the
Emperor Augustus directing him to leave Rome at once, to
take up his abode at Tomi, a dreary Roman outpost on the
Black Sea. near the mouths of the Danube. His property
was not confiscated, but the sentence amounted to perpetual
exile.

The cause of the decree of banishment is not known. The
reason assigned was the impropriety of certain of Ovid's love—
poems, which, however, had been published at least ten years
before and in reality were no worse in their tendencies than
other similar productions of the time. The real reason, hinted
at by Ovid in several poems, was evidently some ground of
private offence which Augustus had against him, the nature
of which can only be conjectured. It seems not unlikely that
the poet had unwittingly witnessed something which if known
might compromise some member of the royal family, and that
he was relegated to Tomi to get him out of the way.
