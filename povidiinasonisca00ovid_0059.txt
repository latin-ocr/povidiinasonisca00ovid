THE GREEK MYTHOLOGY

d. Divinities of the Underworld.

The Underworld was conceived of as a vast, gloomy region
beneath the earth, the abode of the dead. The entrance was
guarded by Kerberos (Latin Cerberus), a horrible monster with
three dog-like heads. Beyond the entrance on every side

fiowed black water, across which Charo'n, stern and repulsive ·

boatman, ferried the spirits of the dead. The good sared well
in a place set apart for them. But the wicked suffered various
forms of punishment, according to the nature and extentos
their sins on earth. Tantalos, for example, a king who had
violated the confidence of Zeus, was placed in a lake 3 though
always thirsty, always hungry, yet he was never able to touch
either the water, which receded as he tried to drink‚ or the
boughs laden with delicious fruit that hung just beyond his
reach. Sisyphos, a wicked king of Corinth, was compelled
to keep rolling up hill a huge stone, that rolled down again
as soon as he had brought it to the top. Ixib‘n was bound
to an ever-revolving wheel3 and the daughters of Danaos
(Latin Danaus) were forced to keep filling jars with holes
in the bottom. See p. 250.

The divinities of the Underworld were : ,

platan, also called A'z'dbneus and A'z‘dZs (English Pluto),
ruler of the Underworld. As the Underworld was
thought of as the storehouse of seeds and source of
wealth, Pluto was also considered a giver of wealth. He
is sometimes confused with Ploulos (Latin platus), a
personification of wealth.

PersephonZ (Latin Prbserpina), daughter of Zeus and
Demeter, and wife of Pluto. Zeus had promised her
to Pluto without the mother's knowledge. As Perse·
