16 INTRODUCTION

and Romans, there is abundant evidence to prove that they
are a survival from an earlier and ruder period.

Among the myths of all peoples there is a marked simi-
larity. This may be accounted for on the supposition either
that myths are everywhere the outgrowth of the same causes,
and are developed in the same stage of human progress, or
that certain mythical conceptions became prevalent in the
remote time before the race was dispersed from a common
centre, and were carried thence to every part of the earth.
For at least one great branch of the human family‚—the
Indo-European‚—the distribution of myths from a common
source seems well established. The comparison of languages
long ago made it clear that the Hindoos and Persians, the
Greeks, Romans, and Kelts, the Russians, and the Teutonic
peoples (represented by the Germans, Dutch, and English),
must have descended from a single stock, the original loca-
tion of which is by no means settled. A like comparison of
myths has brought to light so many that in outline at least
are common to all, or nearly all, the Indo-European peo-
ples, that their dissemination from the parent-folk appears
certain. That a considerable number of myths should have
spread from one people to another, and hence all over the
world, is in the highest degree unlikely. But as researches
in Comparative Mythology are still in their infancy, it is un-
safe at present to state as established any conclusions regard-
- ing the distribution of myths outside of the Indo-European
family.

Myths may be classified either according to the subJects of
which they treat, or according to the kind of supernatura]
personages appearing in them.

According to subject, the principal classes are :—
