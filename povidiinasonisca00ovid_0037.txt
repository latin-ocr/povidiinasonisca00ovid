forms of expression generally used by Greek and Roman
writers, the manner of Ovid has justly gained for him the
characterization, “the most modern of the ancients.’'

The influence of Ovid upon modern literature has been very
· great. The early Italian writers in particular give evidence of
intimate acquaintance with his works. In the most creative
periods of English literature he was more widely read and
appreciated than at present. The writings of Spenser, Shake-

Ovid was preferred to Vergil and Horace. To-day, when
critical and scientific tendencies are paramount in literature,
the highly finished poetry of Horace and Vergil is more popu-

poet.

To modern artists Ovid has suggested more themes for
artistic treatment than any other ancient writer. Collections
of paintings and engravings everywhere are full of mythological
or romantic scenes, recalling his word-pictures. Not merely
the humbler artists, but more than one of the great masters,
have consecrated their genius to setting forth his conceptions.

to handle than the hexameter, adopted it as the metre of
didactic as well as lyric productions, using it even in the
