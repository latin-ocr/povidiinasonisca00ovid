THE GREEK AND THE ROMAN MYTHOLOGY W

Myths of the beginning and govemment of the world,
of the origin and early fortunes of man,
of the origin of arts, institutions, and observances,
of death and the hereafter,

of the heavenly bodies,
of heroic and romantic adventure or incident.

Classified according to their supernatural elements, there
are:—

Myths of deities,
of heroes,
of unnatural heings, such as witches, monsters, an-

imals with human traits, and the like.

The origin of myths has been accounted for in various
ways. Among the Greeks at least four explanations were
proposed. The earliest was that the divinities of mythology
are a personification of the elements and powers of nature,
the relations and conflicts of which are thus figuratively set
forth. Some considered myths an invention of cunning rulers,
who thought by this means to inspire a feeling of awe in the
masses and keep them in check3 using the myths, as Aristotle
remarks, ‘for the persuasion of the many, and as a means of
pressure in favor of laws.' Others attached to them a hidden
significance, and interpreted them as allegories intended to
suggest moral or religious truth. Euemerus, a Sicilian Greek
of the time of Alexander the Great, maintained that the gods
and heroes were originally men distinguished for their prowess
and exploits, and that mythology in a distorted way presents
facts of early history.

This last theory was favored by some of the early Christian
writers, though others considered the pagan deities as demons
who had troubled the world before the coming of Christ. In
