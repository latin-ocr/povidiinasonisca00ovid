ι’ Hennaeis (‘0f Henna‚' or ‘of Enna ') est lacus allae aquae,
ψ, nomine Pergus. The city of Henna was situated at the very

simply to color. Milton has sketched a similar scene (⁶⁶ Para·

' “Or the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley spread her store,
Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose.
